A simple AngularJS/Bootstrap3 boilerplate (city geolocation included) to start on small personal projects. This includes some useful filters and directives. A global layout, header (menu) and footer on demand (ng-include with a if condition). 2 partials : a login one (through fake social networks connectors) and a chat one.
